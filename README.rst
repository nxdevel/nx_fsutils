Miscellaneous file/directory utilities.

Support for adding opening files as a context to functions/generators that
would typically accept file objects is provided.

These utilities accommodate some, but not all, issues surrounding pathes.

A class and generator are included that allow reading lines based on a
specified delimiter.

Other miscellaneous utilities I find useful are also included:
    * makedir - making directories that may exist
    * checksum - md5 and sha256
    * line_count
    * is_ascii - check to determine whether a file needs closer inspection
